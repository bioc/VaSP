Description: Discovery of genome-wide variable alternative splicing events from 
    short-read RNA-seq data and visualizations of gene splicing information for 
    publication-quality multi-panel figures in a population. (Warning: The 
    visualizing function is removed due to the dependent package Sushi 
    deprecated. If you want to use it, please change back to an older version.)
